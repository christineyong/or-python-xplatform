# OR in Python with Cbc & CyLP
This repository contains scripts for the easy installation of the [Cbc solver](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc) and [CyLP](https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP) into a new `conda` environment. CyLP is a Python interface to COIN-ORâ€™s Linear and mixed-integer program solvers.

# Usage
1. Ensure that you have Anaconda or miniconda installed *and* either:
    1. Added to your `PATH` (Unix-like systems), *OR* 
    1. You have Anaconda Prompt installed (Windows systems)
1. Clone this repository by running the following in your command prompt:
    
    ```git clone https://github.com/christineyong/or-python-xplatform.git```
    
1. Continue to the relevant section below.

## macOS on M1 Macbooks (ARM64 architecture)
1. In your favourite terminal, descend into the `or-python-xplatform` directory you cloned.
1. Run `bash cfg_macos_arm64.sh`.
1. Re-start your terminal and run `conda activate or_training`.
1. Run `pytest` to verify that everything has been installed correctly.

## macOS on Intel Macbooks (x86-64 architecture)
1. In your favourite terminal, descend into the `or-python-xplatform` directory you cloned.
1. Run `bash cfg_macos_intel.sh`.
1. Re-start your terminal and run `conda activate or_training`.
1. Run `pytest` to verify that everything has been installed correctly.

## Linux
Installation on Linux is the simplest, so I have not created the scripts or instructions for installation on this OS.

## Windows
1. In the Anaconda Powershell Prompt, descend into the `or-python-xplatform` directory you cloned.
1. Run `.\cfg_win32.bat`. If prompted for a password, press Enter to skip. The `bat` file will download and run the latest COIN-OR installer at the time of writing. Complete the installation this using all defaults and click "Yes" to all pop-ups. The script will continue after COIN-OR installation is done.
1. Re-start Anaconda Powershell Prompt and run `conda activate or_training`.
1. Run `pytest` to verify that everything has been installed correctly.
